# Fun Calculator README

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** — a simple and fun Python program that lets you do basic arithmetic operations with two numbers! 🎉😎

## What It Does

This program will prompt you to enter two numbers (decimals are totally fine!), then it will:

- Add them ➕
- Subtract the second from the first ➖
- Multiply them ✖️
- Divide the first by the second ➗

Finally, it prints out all the results for you to see.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number.
4. View your arithmetic results displayed on the screen.

## Important Notes

- The program uses `float()` to accept decimal numbers.
- **Important:** Do **not** enter zero as the second number when asked, because dividing by zero will cause an error.
- This is a simple calculator meant to demonstrate basic operations — no error handling or fancy UI here!

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3.5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 13.5
Difference: 6.5
Product: 35.0
Quotient: 2.857142857142857
```

## Have fun with your mini-calculator! 😎💻🎉

If you want to improve it, consider adding:
- Error handling (e.g., avoid dividing by zero)
- Support for more operations
- A loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting

Enjoy coding!
